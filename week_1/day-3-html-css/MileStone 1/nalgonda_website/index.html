    <h1>Welcome to Nalgonda</h1>
    Nalgonda is a city and municipality in the Indian state of Telangana. 
    <br>
    It is the headquarters of the homonymous district, as well as the headquarters of the Nalgonda mandal in the Nalgonda revenue division.
    <br>
    The city's name is derived from two Telugu words: nalla ("black") and konda ("hill").
    <br>
    In the past, Nalgonda was referred to as Nilagiri. During the medieval Bahamani kingdom, it was renamed Nallagonda.
    <br>
    The name was changed to "Nalgonda" for official uses during the rule of the later Nizam kings.
